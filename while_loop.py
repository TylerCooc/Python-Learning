#while loops in Python are a structure that allow for you loop and execute code multiple times while a condition is true
#The loop will stop when the condition becomes false.

i = 1
while i <= 10: #every time it loops and checks the condition and continuously executes the code until it is not true. 
    print(i)
    i = i + 1

print("Done with loop")
