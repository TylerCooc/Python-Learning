#tuples are a type of data structure
#They are a container that stores different values
#Tuple is similar but different to a list
#Tuples are immutable (immutable means that they cannot be changed or modified)
#tuples are used for data that is never going to change
#lists are used for data that may be changed or may not be changed. Lists are not immutable
#tuples are very niche 

coordinates = (4,5) #tuples uses parenthesis for syntax

#coordinates[1] = 10, python will give an error if you try to change the value

print(coordinates)
print(coordinates[0])
print(coordinates[1])

coordinates =[(4,5), (6,7), (80,34)] #list of tuples
